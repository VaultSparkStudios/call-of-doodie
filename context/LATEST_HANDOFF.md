# Latest Handoff

## Where We Left Off (Session 43)
- Shipped: architecture/perf/polish groundwork — context refresh, helper extraction, modal lazy-loading, warning cleanup, and Route Select bugfix
- Tests: `116/116` passing
- Deploy: pending

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: convert the audit into durable project memory and begin the highest-leverage implementation slice instead of scattering effort across all roadmap items
- intent outcome: Partial and correct — roadmap/context were upgraded, and the first architecture/perf cleanup slice was shipped; the deeper roadmap items remain queued rather than falsely marked complete
- completed this session: `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`, `context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and `context/CURRENT_STATE.md` updated to carry the expanded ranked roadmap forward
- completed this session: component-bound helper exports were extracted into `src/utils/perkOptions.js` and `src/utils/routeOptions.js`, reducing fast-refresh debt and untangling `App.jsx` imports from component files
- completed this session: `MenuScreen.jsx` now lazy-loads non-core overlay panels (`LeaderboardPanel`, `AchievementsPanel`, `SettingsPanel`, `MetaTreePanel`, `SupporterModal`) so first-contact UI cost is lower
- completed this session: `RouteSelectModal.jsx` no longer overrides its focused outline with a duplicate style key
- completed this session: touched UI files (`MenuScreen`, `TutorialOverlay`, `SettingsPanel`, `SupporterModal`, `PerkModal`, `RouteSelectModal`) were cleaned to reduce warning debt and make future UI decomposition safer
- completed this session: `src/App.jsx` hook dependency cleanup removed the remaining lint warnings without regressing the launch smoke path
- validation baseline: `npm test` 116/116, `npm run build` passes, `npm run lint` 0 errors / 0 warnings

## Next Recommended Slice
- [ ] Continue the `src/App.jsx` split with one concrete domain extraction, not a broad rewrite
- [ ] Rework the menu around recommended next action and progressive disclosure
- [ ] Upgrade leaderboard trust from heuristics-only plausibility checks to richer server validation
- [ ] Turn the death debrief into a cause-of-death and corrective-rematch loop

## Where We Left Off (Session 42)
- Shipped: 5 improvements across 4 groups — security/trust (score plausibility validation), run-feedback (tactical death debrief), pre-run UX (command briefing), build depth/economy clarity (archetype capstones + build-fit recommendations)
- Tests: 116/116 passing · delta: +6 (2 new utility test files, launch smoke still green)
- Deploy: pending — ready to push; no post-push live verification run in this session

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: audit the project, rank the biggest opportunities, then ship the highest-value refinement blocks instead of diluting effort across the full roadmap
- intent outcome: Achieved — encoded the roadmap in repo memory, shipped the top trust/feedback/build-identity improvements, and left the remaining work ranked by payoff
- completed this session: `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` added and linked from project memory; `TASK_BOARD`, `CURRENT_STATE`, and `LATEST_HANDOFF` updated to carry the ranked roadmap forward
- completed this session: `supabase/functions/submit-score/index.ts` now rejects implausible runs via score/kills/damage/time envelopes and fixes claimed-callsign comparison to use resolved `uid`
- completed this session: `src/utils/runDebrief.js` + tests added; `src/components/DeathScreen.jsx` now renders a tactical debrief with verdict, build identity, strengths, and next-best moves
- completed this session: `src/components/MenuScreen.jsx` now renders a command brief for the selected mode/loadout and weekly mutation before deploy
- completed this session: `src/utils/buildArchetypes.js` + tests added; aligned perk picks now unlock build capstones (Vanguard, Gunslinger, Demolitionist, Tempo) and the current build is surfaced in the HUD
- completed this session: `PerkModal`, `WaveShopModal`, and `RouteSelectModal` now mark build-fit recommendations so players can steer into coherent builds
- validation baseline: `npm test` 116/116, `npm run lint` 0 errors / 13 existing warnings

## Where We Left Off (Session 41)
- Shipped: 3 improvements across 3 groups — pwa-quality (PNG icon build pipeline), monetization-backend (Ko-fi webhook Edge Function), ci-stability (testTimeout bump)
- Tests: 110/110 passing · delta: 0 (no new test files; behaviour covered by existing launch:verify)
- Deploy: pending — changes uncommitted at session end

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: prepare game for public launch — surface anything missing and fix what's fixable in-repo
- intent outcome: Achieved — audit identified 3 in-repo gaps (PNG icons, Ko-fi webhook, robots.txt); shipped the 2 meaningful fixes, skipped robots.txt with rationale (subpath deploy — only origin-root robots.txt is honored by crawlers)
- completed this session: `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` added (sharp-based SVG→PNG converter, skip-if-fresh), `public/icon-192.png` + `public/icon-512.png` generated and committed, manifest.json + index.html wired to PNGs (SVG kept as fallback), `public/sw.js` bumped to `cod-v4` with PNGs precached, `prebuild` hook ensures PNGs stay in sync
- completed this session: `supabase/functions/kofi-webhook/index.ts` created — validates Ko-fi `verification_token`, extracts callsign from `message` field, upserts `callsign_claims.supporter = true`, idempotent via `kofi_events.message_id`
- completed this session: `supabase/migrations/2026-04-14_kofi_webhook.sql` — new `kofi_events` audit table with RLS enabled
- completed this session: `.github/workflows/deploy-supabase-function.yml` extended to auto-deploy the kofi-webhook function
- completed this session: `supabase/functions/README.md` updated with kofi-webhook deploy instructions + webhook URL format
- completed this session: `vite.config.js` sets `testTimeout: 15000` — launch smoke was flaky near 5s default under CPU load (observed 1.2s–5.5s); safely within budget now
- completed this session: `npm run launch:verify` re-run against production — 14/14 live assertions pass (health check 5/5, live site 5/5, launch surface 4/4, shared leaderboard 1/1)
- validation baseline: `npm test` 110/110, `npm run lint` 0 errors / 13 intentional warnings, `npm run build` produces working dist/ with prebuild icon step wired in

## Human Action Required (Session 42)
- [ ] Physical launch QA — verify PWA install prompt/accept on a real mobile/browser combo
- [ ] Physical launch QA — verify one real gamepad/browser combo end-to-end
- [ ] Create Itch.io listing — use copy from `docs/LAUNCH_EXECUTION.md`, upload media from `public/launch-assets/`
- [ ] Add `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` to GitHub repo Settings → Secrets → Actions
- [ ] Add `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` to GitHub repo Settings → Secrets → Actions
- [ ] Apply `supabase/migrations/2026-04-14_kofi_webhook.sql` in Supabase SQL editor (creates `kofi_events` table — required before the webhook's first call)
- [ ] Set `KOFI_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` Supabase function secret, then paste `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/kofi-webhook` into Ko-fi → More → Settings → API & Webhooks
