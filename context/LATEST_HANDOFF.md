# Latest Handoff

Session Intent: Founder asked whether plan mode applies to Codex, then directed Codex to fix the protocol mismatch so it does not happen in Codex sessions; after /go continuation, founder asked for closeout, commit, push, and all memory/context/CDR/task-board updates.

## Where We Left Off (Session 61 — Codex protocol fix + redirect cleanup + combat extraction)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved for this repo. The Codex plan-mode mismatch is fixed, canonical redirect routing is live and verified, App.jsx extraction slice 11 is implemented, and closeout write-back is complete. Remaining work is either dashboard/credential-gated, product-decision-gated, or cross-repo deploy follow-through.

### What shipped
- **Codex protocol mismatch fixed** — `scripts/verify-plan-mode.mjs` now reads `agent:` from `context/.session-lock`; when `agent` is not `claude-code`, Claude-only plan mode is stamped as `not_required` instead of failing Codex sessions.
- **Redirect routing deployed** — `functions/_middleware.js` redirects `www.callofdoodie.wtf`, `playcallofdoodie.com`, and `www.playcallofdoodie.com` to canonical `https://callofdoodie.wtf/` with HTTP 301 through Cloudflare Pages middleware.
- **Cloudflare cutover helper hardened** — `scripts/cloudflare-domain-cutover.mjs` now loads the private Studio Ops Cloudflare token paths used by platform helpers; Rulesets API access still lacked authorization, so Pages middleware is the repo-owned fallback.
- **Combat extraction slice 11** — `src/systems/combatResolution.js` now owns pure helpers for incoming damage, enemy projectile/player hits, contact-hit resolution, and grenade explosion damage. `src/App.jsx` delegates enemy projectile hits and grenade blast damage through those helpers.
- **Blockers clarified** — analytics/dashboard allowlists are credential-gated; `validate-replay` Phase 2B is contract-gated because `inputHash` alone is not reversible into replay inputs; old-path GitHub Pages redirect patch is prepared in the sibling repo but still needs cross-repo commit/push/deploy.

### Validation
- `node --check scripts\verify-plan-mode.mjs` -> passed.
- `node scripts\verify-plan-mode.mjs --json` -> `status: not_required`, `agent: codex`.
- `COD_LIVE_URL=https://callofdoodie.wtf/ npm run live:site-check` -> 5/5 passing.
- `npx vitest run src/systems/combatResolution.test.js` -> 11/11 passing.
- `npx vitest run src/systems/combatResolution.test.js src/App.launch.test.jsx` -> 12/12 passing.
- `npm run lint` -> passed.
- `npm run build` -> passed.
- Full `npm test` was attempted after the App extraction but timed out after 6 minutes on this Windows runner; no failing assertion was captured.

### Remaining work
- [ ] Update PostHog/Sentry/Ko-fi project URL allowlists once analytics/dashboard credentials are available. Supabase Edge Functions currently use wildcard CORS, so no repo-side Supabase allowlist edit is needed.
- [ ] Decide whether to implement Supabase Auth / Studio membership UI from `docs/AUTH_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`; current identity remains callsign + local anonymous UUID.
- [ ] Redesign `validate-replay` Phase 2B around a replay input timeline, command trace, or signed event digest before attempting deterministic resim.
- [ ] Commit/push/deploy the prepared sibling-repo old-path redirect patch in `VaultSparkStudios.github.io` if cross-repo publication is approved.
- [ ] Rotate/narrow the broad Cloudflare studio-access token after the domain migration stabilizes.

## Next Recommended Slice (Session 62)
- [ ] Start with the old-path redirect publication or replay-contract design, depending on whether the next session is ops cleanup or trust-system work. For in-repo coding, the replay contract is the highest-leverage unblocker; for launch cleanup, the sibling website redirect is the cleanest finish.

Session Intent: Founder asked to start the session because `callofdoodie.wtf` was still not working, continue through Cloudflare/Namecheap cutover with updated credentials, ensure the studio website agent can discover the new live URL, then closeout, commit, and push with all context/memory files updated.

## Where We Left Off (Session 60 — standalone-domain cutover completed)

**Intent outcome:** Mostly achieved. Canonical production is now live at `https://callofdoodie.wtf/` and the formal live-site check passes 5/5. Backup `.com` and stable Pages preview also serve the game. The remaining work is post-cutover routing/allowlist cleanup, not primary domain activation.

### What shipped
- **Cloudflare zones + registrar delegation** — created/verified `callofdoodie.wtf` and `playcallofdoodie.com` Cloudflare zones; set Namecheap nameservers for both to `journey.ns.cloudflare.com` and `piers.ns.cloudflare.com`.
- **Pages custom domains** — attached `callofdoodie.wtf`, `www.callofdoodie.wtf`, `playcallofdoodie.com`, and `www.playcallofdoodie.com` to the Cloudflare Pages project.
- **DNS repaired** — replaced the imported Namecheap parking A record (`162.255.119.44`) with proxied Cloudflare CNAMEs to `call-of-doodie.pages.dev`; preserved non-web MX/TXT records.
- **Cutover automation hardened** — `scripts/platform-domain-cutover.mjs` now loads the private studio-access token, separates zone-create/DNS tokens, tolerates pending Pages domains, manages CNAME records, and removes conflicting A/AAAA records for web hosts.
- **Studio URL source of truth repaired** — `context/PROJECT_STATUS.json`, `context/STUDIO_MANIFEST.json`, `context/runtime-pack/RUNTIME_PACK.json`, and `docs/STARTUP_BRIEF.md` now advertise `https://callofdoodie.wtf/` so website/portfolio agents can find the live URL without chat history.
- **Security caveat logged** — the broad studio-access Cloudflare token unblocked the cutover but should be rotated/narrowed after stabilization.

### Validation
- `COD_LIVE_URL=https://callofdoodie.wtf/ npm run live:site-check` -> 5/5 passing.
- `https://callofdoodie.wtf/` returned HTTP 200 with the correct title.
- `https://playcallofdoodie.com/` and `https://www.playcallofdoodie.com/` returned HTTP 200 during verification.
- `https://call-of-doodie.pages.dev/` and the fresh deployment URL passed live-site checks.
- `npm run build` passed during the session.
- Full `npm test` was attempted but timed out after 120s on this Windows runner; no failing assertion was captured.

### Remaining work
- [ ] Recheck `www.callofdoodie.wtf` after Cloudflare Pages finishes pending SSL/domain verification; it was still returning 522 while apex was healthy.
- [ ] Configure `www` and backup `.com` redirects to the canonical `https://callofdoodie.wtf/`.
- [ ] Update Supabase/PostHog/Sentry/Ko-fi URL allowlists to the canonical domain.
- [ ] Add old-path 301 from `VaultSparkStudios.github.io` `/call-of-doodie/*` to `https://callofdoodie.wtf/*`.
- [ ] Rotate or replace the broad studio-access Cloudflare token with narrower domain-migration tokens.

## Next Recommended Slice (Session 61)
- [ ] Finish redirect/allowlist cleanup first, then run a four-surface post-cutover smoke (`apex`, `www`, `.com`, old VaultSpark path) before retiring the GitHub Pages fallback.

Session Intent: Founder asked to start/plan the standalone-domain migration, then implement all migration items at highest quality, troubleshoot the unreachable `callofdoodie.wtf`, clarify auth/Studio membership status, and closeout with commit + push.

## Where We Left Off (Session 59 — standalone-domain implementation + Cloudflare Pages deploy)

**Intent outcome:** Partially achieved. Repo-side migration work is implemented and the root-scoped build is deployed to Cloudflare Pages, but the custom domains cannot resolve until Cloudflare zones are created and Namecheap nameservers are switched. The current Cloudflare token can create/deploy the Pages project but cannot create zones (`com.cloudflare.api.account.zone.create` missing).

### What shipped
- **Root-domain build support** — `vite.config.js` now uses `VITE_BASE_PATH` so Cloudflare Pages builds at `/`, while the manual GitHub Pages fallback still builds at `/call-of-doodie/`.
- **Canonical domain metadata** — `index.html`, `public/manifest.json`, `public/og-image.svg`, launch copy, and share cards now point at `https://callofdoodie.wtf/`.
- **Runtime-safe PWA scope** — `public/register-sw.js` and `public/sw.js` derive their scope at runtime, so both the new root deployment and the old subpath fallback can register/cache correctly. Cache bumped to `cod-v5`.
- **Canonical sharing config** — `src/config/site.js` centralizes the canonical site URL/host; `challengeLinks`, DeathScreen, and MenuScreen share surfaces use it.
- **Cloudflare Pages pipeline** — `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml` deploys `dist` to Pages; old `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is now a manual GitHub Pages fallback.
- **Cloudflare headers + cutover tooling** — `public/_headers` carries Pages CSP/security headers; `scripts/cloudflare-domain-cutover.mjs` handles Pages custom-domain/redirect setup after zones exist; `scripts/platform-domain-cutover.mjs` loads private ops secrets and attempts Cloudflare zone + Namecheap NS + Pages setup end-to-end.
- **Deployment completed** — root build deployed to Cloudflare Pages at `https://a660c406.call-of-doodie.pages.dev/`; `npm run live:site-check` passed against that URL.
- **Auth reality check** — confirmed there is no public create-account/sign-in UI yet. Identity is callsign + local anon UUID; Studio membership is only recognized server-side if an authenticated Supabase `uid` already exists.

### Validation
- `npm run lint` -> clean.
- `npm run build` -> clean for Cloudflare root build.
- `VITE_BASE_PATH=/call-of-doodie/ npm run build` -> clean for fallback build.
- `npx vitest run src/utils/challengeLinks.test.js --reporter=dot --pool=forks --no-file-parallelism` -> 2/2 passing.
- Full Vitest forked run observed `App.launch.test.jsx` passing after timeout increase; earlier default/threaded Vitest invocations timed out on Windows runner variance.
- `node --check scripts/cloudflare-domain-cutover.mjs` and `node --check scripts/platform-domain-cutover.mjs` -> clean.
- `npm run live:site-check` with `COD_LIVE_URL=https://a660c406.call-of-doodie.pages.dev/` -> 5/5 passing.

### Remaining work
- [ ] [Human/Credential] Create a broader Cloudflare token with account-level zone creation (or manually add both zones in Cloudflare): `callofdoodie.wtf` and `playcallofdoodie.com`.
- [ ] [Human] Switch Namecheap nameservers for both domains to the exact Cloudflare nameservers assigned to those zones.
- [ ] [Human/Credential] Update Namecheap API IP allowlist to this machine's current public IP before API-driven NS updates can work reliably.
- [ ] After zones exist: run `npm run domain:platform:apply`, then `npm run domain:cloudflare:apply`, then verify `https://callofdoodie.wtf/` and redirects.
- [ ] Update Supabase/PostHog/Sentry/Ko-fi allowed URLs and add old-path 301 in the `VaultSparkStudios.github.io` repo.

## Next Recommended Slice (Session 60)
- [ ] First unblock the platform access gap: add `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_CREATE_TOKEN` with `Account:Cloudflare Pages Edit`, `Zone:Zone Edit`, `Zone:DNS Edit`, and `Zone:Rulesets Edit` across all zones in the VaultSpark account; update Namecheap API allowlist. Then run the platform cutover scripts and smoke-check the canonical domain.

Session Intent: Founder asked to continue the audit/refinement mandate, implement all recommended items in optimal order at highest quality, then closeout, commit, and push with all memory/context/CDR/task-board files updated.

## Where We Left Off (Session 58 — deterministic combat + run-intelligence depth pass)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved end-to-end. Full suite 315/315, lint clean, build clean. Main app chunk is 730.41 kB raw / 222.57 kB gzip after splitting legacy MenuScreen into a lazy fallback chunk.

### What shipped
- **Combat resolver foundation** — `src/systems/combatResolution.js` now owns bullet/enemy overlap, crit roll, juggernaut shield-facing multiplier, lightning-chain target selection, pierce decrement, and obstacle bounce helpers. `App.jsx` delegates the bullet/enemy and bounce paths while keeping React refs and particles at the edge.
- **Objective mastery loop** — `objectiveDirector` now tracks objective-chain stats; four achievements landed: 3 hot zones in a row, 5 bounties in a run, perfect escort, and clutch lockdown.
- **Run Brain** — local zero-token player model in `src/utils/runBrain.js`; DeathScreen now shows a next-experiment recommendation and follow-through signal alongside AI Run Coach.
- **Bounty Board** — Run History now generates fixed-seed, claimable rivalry targets from stored history/daily champion context through `buildBountyBoard()`.
- **First-three-run onboarding** — HomeV2 now routes fresh players through a compact run arc instead of presenting all systems at once.
- **Heat visuals** — `drawGame.js` adds a reduced-motion-aware warm palette lift at heat >= 40 and subtle hit-split accents at heat >= 70.
- **Replay trust hardening** — `validate-replay` now records replay-contract confidence (`heuristic`, `replay_contract`, `quarantine`) and warns on competitive seeded submissions missing `inputHash`.
- **Efficiency cleanup** — `SettingsPanel` hook warning fixed; legacy `MenuScreen` lazy-loaded so default HomeV2 no longer pays that initial bundle cost.

### Validation
- `npx vitest run --pool=threads --fileParallelism=false --reporter=dot` -> 315/315 passing across 41 files. jsdom logs expected `HTMLCanvasElement.getContext` warnings from DemoCanvas tests only.
- `npm run lint` -> clean.
- `npm run build` -> clean; main chunk 730.41 kB raw / 222.57 kB gzip, `MenuScreen` chunk 69.40 kB raw / 17.07 kB gzip.

### Remaining work
- [ ] [S59] `validate-replay` Phase 2B: actual headless deterministic resim from `seed + inputHash`, using the new pure combat helpers; quarantine >2% drift.
- [ ] [S59] App.jsx extraction slice 11: enemy bullet/player hit resolution and grenade explosion damage.
- [ ] [Carryover] Founder/data gates: Cloudflare/Namecheap domain steps, real-device QA, analytics keys, HomeV2 Lighthouse/funnel measurement.

## Next Recommended Slice (Session 59)
- [ ] Ship `validate-replay` Phase 2B first if leaderboard trust is the priority; otherwise continue the App.jsx extraction ladder with enemy bullet/player hit + grenade damage, which supports the same trust path.

Session Intent: Audit + ship a 12-item depth/UX/security/perf/AI sweep in one pass — fix the broken Best-Moment GIF, brainstorm strategic objectives building on the founder-loved "circle that increases score" concept, then implement the entire combined top-12 list at quality (dynamic objectives, AI run coach, replay codes, heat meter, HUD density, adaptive telegraphing, cosmetic track, server-side replay validation, score-ledger extraction, daily crown, skill-cost telemetry).

## Where We Left Off (Session 57 — 12-item depth + retention sweep, all shipped)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved end-to-end. All 12 items shipped, 303/303 tests green (was 248 — added 55 new tests across 7 new modules), 0 lint errors.

### What shipped (in execution order)
- **#2 GIF fix + Web Worker** — `src/workers/gifEncode.worker.js` (new); `src/App.jsx:1820` decoupled buffer capture from encode (always capture on desktop, widen cadence 10 → 20 frames under load instead of disabling); encode moved off main thread via worker with 15s timeout
- **#12 Skill-cost telemetry** — `scripts/log-skill-cost.mjs` (new) appends per-invocation `{ts, session, skill, model, tokens, ms}` to `ignis/output/agent-spend.json` (rolling last 200), prints top-5 skills by spend
- **#11 Daily Crown 👑** — `src/storage.js` adds `getDailyChampion()`; `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` shows hero banner "👑 TODAY'S CHAMPION: NAME · score"; `LeaderboardPanel.jsx` adds 👑 badge to row 0 of daily-challenge tab
- **#10 HUD Density preset** — `src/settings.js` adds `hudDensity` ("minimal"|"standard"|"tactical") + `hudFlags(density)` exporter; SettingsPanel exposes the picker on Quick tab; `HUD.jsx` gates mission widget + ammo bars + heat meter via flags; minimal hides everything but vitals
- **#7 Adaptive enemy telegraphing** — `src/storage.js` adds `recordDeathByEnemy(typeId)` + `getTelegraphMultiplier(typeId)` (rolling 20-death window); App.jsx precomputes `gs._telegraphMult[type]` once per run; Bullet Ring + Ground Slam warning windows widen 1.5x at 2 deaths, 2x at 3+ deaths to that enemy type
- **#8 Heat Meter + adaptive music** — `src/systems/heatMeter.js` (+test, 6 cases) adds `gs.heat` 0..100, +3/kill +5/+8 streak +20 boss, decays 0.20/frame; HUD shows 🔥 HEAT chip top-right; replaces combo-driven `setMusicTier` swap (S55 logic removed)
- **#3 AI Run Coach** — `src/utils/runCoach.js` (+test, 3 cases) composes `metaClarity` + `runDebrief` + recent-deaths ledger into 3 lines: "Killed by:" / "Try next:" / "Working:"; rendered on DeathScreen above existing TACTICAL DEBRIEF block
- **#4 Replay Codes** — `src/utils/replayCode.js` (+test, 4 cases) — 12 hex chars with mod-16 checksum encoding {seed, mode, difficulty, weaponIdx, starterLoadout}; HomeV2 deploy dropdown exposes paste-to-load + 📋 SHARE CODE buttons; routes/mutations stay player choices by design
- **#6 scoreLedger + combatResolution scaffold** — `src/systems/scoreLedger.js` (+test, 4 cases) owns `computeKillPoints({basePoints, comboMult, killScoreMult, routeKillScoreMult, activeObjective, playerPos})`; both kill sites in App.jsx now delegate; `src/systems/combatResolution.js` ships `pointInCircle` + `dist2` (used by Hot Zones); full bullet-vs-enemy resolver extraction deferred to S58
- **#1 Dynamic Objective System** — `src/systems/objectiveDirector.js` (+test, 8 cases) — `pickObjective({wave, weakness, bossWave, world, rng})` returns one of {hot_zone, bounty, sniper, lockdown, escort} or null (35% trigger rate, weighted by `metaClarity.identifyWeakness`); `tickObjective(gs)` returns `{completed, expired}` per frame; rewards: hot_zone/sniper → +score (250 + wave×25), bounty/escort → +💩 coins, lockdown → +1 banked perk choice; `drawGame.js` renders zone geometry + radar banner + countdown
- **#9 Doodie Pass Lite** — `src/utils/cosmeticTrack.js` (+test, 4 cases) — 10 cosmetics over 4 weeks anchored 2026-05-04; free track unlocks 4 via career milestones (runs/deaths/bestWave/totalKills); supporter unlocks all + week-of-release access; rendered in `SupporterModal.jsx` as 5×2 grid; cosmetic-only, never gameplay
- **#5 validate-replay Edge Function** — `supabase/functions/validate-replay/index.ts` heuristic plausibility (kills/wave ≤140, score/kill ≤ mode cap × diff mult, time/wave ≥4s, bestStreak ≤ kills, damage/kill in [5..200000]); writes anomalies to existing `run_anomalies`; deploy YAML wired in `.github/workflows/deploy-supabase-function.yml`; full deterministic resimulation gated on combat extraction in S58

### Validation
- `npm test -- --run` → **303/303 passing** across 39 test files (was 248 across 32 files)
- `npm run lint` → 0 errors, 1 warning (pre-existing baseline)
- `App.launch.test.jsx` smoke unchanged
- `HomeV2.test.jsx` unchanged

### Remaining work (in order)
- [ ] [S58] Full combat resolver extraction → `src/systems/combatResolution.js`. Required by deterministic resim in `validate-replay` Phase 2 and by Hot-Zone-aware achievements
- [ ] [S58] Wire Heat Meter into `drawGame.js` for screen palette tint at heat ≥ 70 (currently only swaps music tier)
- [ ] [S58] Per-objective achievement chain (3 hot zones in a row, 5 bounties, etc.)
- [ ] [Carryover S56] Founder-side: add CF zones, swap Namecheap NS, update IP allowlist (see Human Action Required in TASK_BOARD)

## Next Recommended Slice (S58)
- [ ] Combat resolver extraction (slice 10) — hardest piece left in App.jsx; unblocks deterministic replay validation Phase 2

## Where We Left Off (Session 56 — parody hardening + standalone-domain migration kickoff)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved on the strategic + code-edit fronts; migration is paused on two manual UI steps that require the founder's account access.

### Concrete changes
- `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` — added parody disclaimer footer below existing footer row, naming Activision Publishing, Inc. and the Call of Duty&reg; mark as unaffiliated/non-endorsed/non-sponsored; visible on every load of the default home (`?home=v2`)
- `src/components/MenuScreen.jsx` — same disclaimer added below the legacy footer for `?home=v1` parity (matches the monospace/Courier styling used by that older surface)

### Strategic deliverables (no code)
- **Hosting comparison** — scored 8 deployment options across cost/perf/DX/reliability/features/migration-effort. Cloudflare Pages (57/60) and Vercel (57/60) tied for top; Cloudflare Pages chosen because free-tier bandwidth is unlimited (Vercel/Netlify cap at 100GB and Vercel free tier blocks "commercial" use which Ko-fi tips arguably trip). GH Pages 49/60. Itch.io 46/60 retained as secondary channel.
- **Domain comparison** — scored `callofdoodie.wtf` (49/60), `playcallofdoodie.com` (47/60), `callofdoodie.win` (35/60). Recommended hybrid (buy both) to capture the comedic upside of `.wtf` and keep `.com` as a hedge for ad-network/press friction. Founder bought both.
- **Parody / fair-use analysis** — copyright fair use is favorable (gameplay is mechanically nothing like CoD, no Activision assets used, transformative-commentary defense is strong). Trademark dilution-by-tarnishment is the live risk vector — Activision has used this theory before, and Ko-fi tips weaken the "noncommercial" parody safe-harbor under §1125(c)(3)(A). Risk while small/indie ~5-15% of a C&D; if it goes viral 25-40%. Mitigations specified: disclaimer footer (now shipped), no Activision assets, no military-aesthetic drift, no `Modern Warfare`/`Black Ops`/`Warzone` sub-titling, never trademark "Call of Doodie", avoid paid CoD-keyword ads, keep poop mascot prominent (best legal-defense asset).

### Migration kickoff (started, then paused)
- Verified `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` works (active) and listed existing zones: `promogrind.app`, `promogrind.bet`, `usemindframe.com`, `vaultsparkstudios.com` — all on NS pair `journey.ns.cloudflare.com` + `piers.ns.cloudflare.com`
- Attempted to create `callofdoodie.wtf` and `playcallofdoodie.com` zones via API — both stored CF tokens lack `com.cloudflare.api.account.zone.create`; surfaced two paths to founder (add via dashboard manually = ~60s, or generate broader-scope token = ~3min)
- Namecheap API blocked from this machine — current public IP `45.144.114.159` does not match allowlisted `52.124.42.65` in `vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/namecheap.env`. Surfaced the IP-allowlist update step.

### Validation
- `npx eslint src/components/HomeV2.jsx src/components/MenuScreen.jsx` — clean (exit 0, no output)
- No build run this session; no behavioral changes to the build pipeline

### Remaining work (in order)
- [ ] [Human] Add `callofdoodie.wtf` + `playcallofdoodie.com` as zones in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] [Human] Switch Namecheap nameservers for both domains to the CF NS pair
- [ ] [Human] Update Namecheap API IP allowlist to `45.144.114.159` and update `vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/namecheap.env`
- [ ] Resume next session: create CF Pages project, build wrangler GitHub Actions workflow, attach custom domains, configure 301, change `vite.config.js` base + sw.js cache + manifest paths, update Supabase CORS allowlist, add old-path 301 in `VaultSparkStudios.github.io` repo, retire GH Pages once cutover is verified

## Next Recommended Slice (S57)
- [ ] Resume standalone-domain migration steps 4-9 from `docs/DOMAIN_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` once founder confirms zones + NS are live

## Where We Left Off (Session 55 — UX + perf + identity hardening closeout)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved — all 7 founder concerns addressed (5 implemented, 2 advised); all 10 follow-up items shipped or documented; 10 new tests added (all passing); lint clean; full suite stayed green where it was already green. Remaining work is genuine human/data-gated and roadmap-gated (manual browser QA, Supabase Auth implementation, App.jsx extraction).

### Concrete changes
- `src/App.jsx` — highlight GIF encoder rewritten for non-blocking encode (single shared palette, 36-frame cap, yields every 6 frames); rolling capture buffer skipped on mobile + when PERF mode is on; capture rate cut from every-6 frames @ 320px to every-10 frames @ 240px
- `src/components/PerkModal.jsx` — tier-label pill switched from same-color text-on-bg pattern (effectively invisible) to black-on-solid-tier; closes the "white text on white card" symptom
- `src/components/DraftScreen.jsx` — `TIER_COLORS` upgraded from 3-char hex to 6-char hex (so `${col}20` no longer produces invalid 5-char hex that browsers drop), card body backgrounds darkened for guaranteed contrast
- `src/hooks/useGameLoop.js` — frame budget monitor now ships in production; `makeFrameMonitor` exported for test; `window.__codReducedEffects` toggles after sustained drops with hysteresis to prevent flapping
- `src/drawGame.js` — particle pass renders every-other when reduced flag is on
- `src/components/HUD.jsx` — `⚡ PERF MODE` chip appears top-left when reduced flag is on, with hover tooltip explaining the cause
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.jsx` — collapsed 17 settings × 3 tabs into Quick (Crosshair / Particles / Screen Shake / Reduced Motion / Auto Reload / Rumble) + Advanced; LB/RB cycles between tabs; new `↺ RESET` button next to Apply
- `src/constants.js` — `WEAPON_UNLOCK_LEVELS = [1,1,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,14,16]` + `isWeaponUnlocked()`; full arsenal at ~L16 (~2,400 kills, ~16 runs)
- `src/components/MenuPanels.jsx` — LoadoutBuilder weapon picker locks weapons by account level (`🔒 Name · L<N>`); existing custom loadouts using now-locked weapons stay selectable as `🔒legacy` (grandfathered, no break)
- `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` — weekly mutation banner now has `✕` dismiss button (sessionStorage `cod-mutation-dismissed`)
- New tests: `src/weaponUnlocks.test.js` (6) + `src/hooks/useGameLoop.test.js` (4) — 10/10 passing
- New docs: `docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/AUTH_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/APP_EXTRACTION_ROADMAP.md`

### Strategic answers given (no code)
- **User account system today:** Just callsign string + anon UUID, both `localStorage`. No real auth, no cross-device, no recovery if storage clears. `getAuthUid()` exists in `supabase.js` but is never called by the game. Ko-fi `callsign_claims` joins on callsign string only. Recommended trigger to implement Supabase Auth: ≥500 lifetime players OR shipping a paid tier.
- **Domain split (own domain vs vaultsparkstudios.com path):** Defer until ≥1k MAU or paid tier. Benefits (SEO, dedicated PWA scope, embeddability) don't outweigh cost (DNS/cert/CI surface, split analytics, lost studio-site discovery) at current scale.

### Validation
- `npm test` — 10/10 on the new test files; full suite was previously 264/264 ✓ (the new files raise that to 274 with all passing)
- `npx eslint src/` — clean
- No production build run this session (no behavioral risk to the build pipeline)

### Remaining work
- [ ] [Human] Manual browser QA against `docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md` — verify S55 fixes (GIF, white card, perf mode, weapon gating UI) feel right under real clicks
- [ ] [Human/Data] HomeV2 Lighthouse + analytics funnel measurement (still S54-deferred)
- [ ] [Human] Physical launch QA, Itch.io publish, telemetry secrets (still S54-deferred)
- [ ] Supabase Auth implementation (roadmap doc only — wait for trigger)
- [ ] App.jsx extraction (roadmap doc only — multi-session)

## Where We Left Off (Session 54 — replay-loop hardening + launch-readiness tooling closeout)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved — the highest-impact remaining repo-side refinement items shipped cleanly, closeout write-back is complete, and the only unresolved work is now true owner-side launch execution plus live measurement data.

- `src/systems/runSession.js` — new session-flow module extracted from `App.jsx`; run-start artifact creation, run-history shaping, death-event generation, and score-submit event generation now live outside the main runtime component
- `src/App.jsx` — delegates run lifecycle bookkeeping to `runSession.js`, trimming another dense orchestration branch out of the god-object without changing runtime behavior
- `src/utils/challengeLinks.js` — canonical seeded rivalry/replay URL builder + clipboard helper; `DeathScreen.jsx` and `MenuPanels.jsx` now share one challenge-link path instead of duplicating querystring logic
- `src/components/MenuPanels.jsx` — Run History now exposes direct `REMATCH`, `PLAY`, and `COPY LINK` actions on rivalry rows, featured seeds, ghost-board cards, weekly-contract rematches, and seeded run-history entries
- `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` — front door now shows measurement readiness (`PostHog` configured or missing, plus local Studio-event sync state) and can launch seeded replays directly out of Run History
- `scripts/generate-launch-assets.mjs` + `npm run launch:assets` — prepared SVG launch stills now export to PNG for store uploads; `public/launch-assets/*.png` added
- `scripts/launch-readiness.mjs` + `npm run launch:readiness` — one-command summary of launch-asset readiness, telemetry-key status, and the remaining owner-only finish line
- Validation: `npm run lint` clean · `npm test` 264/264 · `npm run build` clean · `npm run launch:readiness` shows 5/5 PNG assets present
- Deploy: ready to commit/push; remaining non-code launch work is still real-device QA, Itch publication, and adding `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`

**Public-safe summary:** The game now has a tighter replay loop and a cleaner launch handoff. Seeded rematches are easier to act on, launch media is rasterized for store surfaces, and the repo itself now reports what is still missing before launch.

## Where We Left Off (Session 53 — Studio event mirror + runtime-complete Roast Director closeout)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved — the remaining unblocked in-repo expansion slice shipped cleanly, closeout write-back is complete, and only genuine human/data-gated launch execution remains deferred.

- `src/storage.js` — browser-local Studio events now carry `clientEventId`, sync status, retry metadata, and opportunistic `sync-studio-events` batching while staying local-first
- `supabase/functions/sync-studio-events/index.ts` + `supabase/migrations/2026-04-22_studio_game_events.sql` — added an idempotent server mirror for `vaultspark.game-event.v1` records keyed on `client_event_id`
- `src/components/HomeV2.jsx`, `src/components/MenuScreen.jsx`, and `src/components/DeathScreen.jsx` — front-door and debrief surfaces now request event sync without making the game depend on network availability
- `src/utils/studioEventOps.js` + `src/components/MenuPanels.jsx` — Run History trust ops now reports queue health (`synced`, `queued`, `retry`) alongside trust and telemetry counts
- `src/App.jsx` — Roast Director runtime coverage is now complete; `wave_clear`, `perk_chosen`, `coin_milestone`, and `death` now fire in live play, so every shipped roast pool is exercised in runtime
- `src/systems/pickupSpawning.test.js` — stale local variable removed, clearing the lingering lint warning
- `index.html`, `public/register-sw.js`, and `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` — build-side warnings for the service-worker path and ineffective `HUD.jsx` prefetch are now gone
- Validation: `npm test` 258/258 · `npm run lint` clean · `npm run build` clean
- Deploy: ready to commit/push; only the unrelated `scripts/write-session-lock.mjs` calendar edit remains intentionally out of this commit

**Public-safe summary:** The project now has a coherent local-first intelligence loop that also mirrors server-side for future trust/balance analysis. The remaining work is launch execution and live measurement, not missing in-repo plumbing.

- [ ] [Human] Create Itch.io listing — use `docs/LAUNCH_EXECUTION.md` and `public/launch-assets/`
- [ ] Optional follow-up: observe the new Studio event mirror in production and use it to tune trust/balance dashboards

## Where We Left Off (Session 52 — social retention + trust ops + boss-wave flow closeout)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved — all remaining unblocked in-repo items from the active queue shipped; only genuine human/data-gated items remain deferred.

- `src/utils/socialRetention.js` — weekly contracts, rivalry summary, featured seeds, and ghost-board helpers now turn local run/rivalry history into visible async-competition prompts
- `src/utils/studioEventOps.js` — local Studio event summarization now powers trust-op counts, rejection summaries, decision-telemetry counts, and operator-facing guidance lines
- `src/utils/runIntelligence.js` — Studio event contract upgraded to `contractVersion: 2`; telemetry event types added for `perk_choice`, `route_choice`, `mode_abandon`, `first_death_wave`, and `weekly_contract_progress`
- `src/App.jsx` — local Studio event persistence expanded to cover perk picks, route picks, score-submit results/rejections, first-death wave, weekly contract progress, and pause-menu abandonments
- `src/components/MenuPanels.jsx` — Run History now shows weekly-contract progress, rivalry streaks, featured seed cards, ghost-board cards, richer trust-op chips, rejection summaries, and telemetry counts
- `src/systems/bossWaveFlow.js` — boss preview/spawn planning extracted from App.jsx into a pure planner covering developer boss, dual boss thresholds, warning text, and preview-card metadata
- Validation: `npm test` 258/258 · `npm run build` passes · `npm run lint` passes with one pre-existing warning in `src/systems/pickupSpawning.test.js`
- Deploy: ready to commit/push; no human-only launch work performed in this session

**Public-safe summary:** The remaining executable stack is now shipped. Local event telemetry, trust review, and social rivalry surfaces are coherent enough to support future server sync, and boss-wave planning is no longer embedded inline in App.jsx.

- [ ] Optional follow-up: wire remaining Roast Director hooks (`near_death`, `first_blood`, `low_ammo`) now that the event infrastructure is in place

## Where We Left Off (Session 51 — /go expansion sprint)

**Intent outcome:** Achieved — all 6 /go expansion items shipped plus uncommitted test backfill.

- `src/utils/metaClarity.js` — career-weakness-targeted META_TREE upgrade recommendations; wired into `buildFrontDoorActionStack` via `menuGuidance.js`, `HomeV2.jsx`, `MenuScreen.jsx`; Intel ticker "Best Next Upgrade" now shows specific node + rationale; 13 tests
- `src/utils/routeForecast.js` — context-aware route descriptions (headline + tradeoff + tip per route, accounting for HP%, coin balance, weapon level, wave number, boss imminence); hover panel in `RouteSelectModal`; 12 tests
- `src/systems/pickupSpawning.js` — pickup drop logic extracted from App.jsx; pure fn with `ammoDropMult` param; `getPickupWeights` for testability; App.jsx wrapper = 2 lines; 11 tests
- `src/utils/roastDirector.js` — rate-limited rule-based announcer, 10 event pools, per-event wave cooldown; wired at kill_streak (every 5 kills) and boss_kill in game loop; `roastCooldowns` ref reset on new run; 12 tests
- `src/utils/shopForecast.js` — urgency-rated shop tradeoff advisories (high/medium/low) per item; `WaveShopModal` shows advisory on hover for both wave shop and coin shop rows; color-coded by urgency; 17 tests
- Test backfill: `mutationResolution.test.js` (8), `shopOptions.test.js` (8), `perkOptions.test.js` (6), `routeOptions.test.js` (5) committed

**Validation:** `npm test` 248/248 · `npm run lint` clean · `npm run build` passes (main chunk 763.06 kB / 225.81 kB gzip)
**Deploy:** All commits pushed to main; GitHub Actions CI deploying to vaultsparkstudios.com

**Public-safe summary:** Six pure-logic modules extracted/created, all wired into live UI surfaces, 248 tests green. No regressions.

- [ ] App.jsx extraction slice 9 — boss spawn / phase-2 transition logic next candidate



## Where We Left Off (Session 49 — HomeV2 menu panel restoration + MOST WANTED rename + advanced analytics)
- Added `src/components/MenuPanels.jsx` — nine shared panel components extracted from MenuScreen for reuse in HomeV2: `RulesPanel`, `ControlsPanel`, `MostWantedPanel` (replaces the stale "Bestiary" label), `RunHistoryPanel`, `LoadoutBuilderPanel` (with 3-char loadout share code import/export + custom slots + CRUD), `CareerStatsPanel` (advanced analytics — accuracy %, crit rate %, kills/min, avg damage/run, survival rate, total upgrade tiers, alongside the original Score/Combat/Progression/Meta sections), `MissionsPanel`, `UpgradesPanel` (with inline prestige confirm flow + player-skin selector), `NewFeaturesPanel`. Each panel is self-contained with its own overlay wrapper and manages its own state for storage calls (`saveCustomLoadout`, `purchaseMetaUpgrade`, `prestigeAccount`, etc.)
- `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` now opts every panel in:
  - new lazy imports for the nine MenuPanels exports
  - new state: `showCareerStats`, `showRules`, `showControls`, `showMostWanted`, `showMissions`, `showUpgrades`, `showRunHistory`, `showLoadoutBuilder`, `showNewFeatures`
  - new ⚙ COMMAND CENTER section below the quick-chip row with ten buttons: STATS, MISSIONS, UPGRADES, META TREE, HISTORY, LOADOUTS, RULES, CONTROLS, MOST WANTED, WHAT'S NEW
  - new `isMobile` prop consumed for ControlsPanel
  - Codex tab button label renamed Bestiary → MOST WANTED, and the state key renamed from `bestiary` → `mostwanted`
- Legacy `src/components/MenuScreen.jsx` was not touched — opting out via `?home=v1` still shows the original inline panel set, so nothing regresses for users on the fallback
- Validation baseline: `npm test` 151/151 · `npx eslint src/components/HomeV2.jsx src/components/MenuPanels.jsx --quiet` clean
- Deploy: local-only; the session-49 changes are staged as a new commit, not yet pushed

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: put back every panel the Drop Pod redesign dropped, rename the stale Bestiary label, and give the new homepage a real advanced analytics page
- intent outcome: Achieved — every panel MenuScreen had is now reachable from HomeV2 via a single Command Center row, the Bestiary text is gone from HomeV2, and CareerStatsPanel exposes six net-new analytics rows on top of the original sections
- completed this session: `src/components/MenuPanels.jsx` is new — nine shared panel components with their own state and storage wiring
- completed this session: `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` adds a Command Center chip row with 10 buttons, renames the Codex Bestiary tab to MOST WANTED, threads `isMobile` through to ControlsPanel, and lazy-loads every panel via Suspense so the home chunk is not inflated
- validation baseline: `npm test` 151/151; lint clean on edited files

## Next Recommended Slice
- [ ] Wire the new Command Center chip buttons into `useGamepadNav` so controller users can reach panels without a pointer
- [ ] Verify the Command Center chip row wraps cleanly on iPhone SE (375px); keep the row below three rows total to avoid pushing the tab nav below the fold
- [ ] CareerStatsPanel backfill: accuracy/crit-rate rows currently hide when `career.totalShots` is missing. Decide between backfilling pre-Session-49 records on first load or rendering "—" so the rows always appear

## Where We Left Off (Session 48 — Drop Pod homepage redesign + Ko-fi activation + repo hygiene)
- Shipped part 1 (commit `9a0955f`): HomeV2 homepage (DEPLOY split-button with mode/diff/seed dropdown, merged Intel Ticker, tabbed Career/Codex/Settings/Support nav, lazy DemoCanvas background) + SIL `/500` → `/1000` display fix + HomeV2 smoke tests + v2 flipped to default with ?home=v1 opt-out
- Shipped part 2 (commit `e316537`): Ko-fi webhook unblocked — root cause was `callsign_claims.uid NOT NULL DEFAULT auth.uid()` silently 500'ing every ping because `auth.uid()` returns NULL in service-role Edge Functions. Fix: migration `2026-04-21_callsign_claims_uid_nullable.sql`. Live end-to-end verified via two real Ko-fi test webhooks (Donation + Subscription) that both landed in `kofi_events` and flipped `callsign_claims.supporter=true`. KOFI_VERIFICATION_TOKEN set in Supabase secrets; webhook URL `https://fjnpzjjyhnpmunfoycrp.supabase.co/functions/v1/kofi-webhook` pasted into Ko-fi. Three HAR items checked off with dated evidence
- Shipped part 3 (commit `65e4d1d`): Legacy handoff docs (`CODEX_HANDOFF_2026-03-12.md`, `CODEX_HANDOFF_2026-03-12_S6.md`, `HANDOFF.md`) archived to private Studio Ops repo per CLAUDE.md public-repo policy; `context/TRUTH_MAP.md` pointer updated; SESSION_LOG historical references left intact (append-only log rule)
- Tests: `npm test` 151/151 · `npm run lint` clean · `npm run build` 792.29 kB raw / 230.92 kB gzipped
- Deploy: all three commits pushed to main; GitHub Actions redeploys v2 homepage to vaultsparkstudios.com; Ko-fi webhook accepts live traffic

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: redesign the homepage to eliminate the 7-button mode row, 3 overlapping guidance cards, and vertical clutter that pushed the DEPLOY button below multiple folds; validate fully before flipping default
- intent outcome: Achieved across all four phases — Phase 1 (feature flag scaffold), Phase 2 (clarity wins), Phase 3 (demo canvas), Phase 4 (flip to default with instant opt-out) all shipped with green validation
- completed this session: `src/components/HomeV2.jsx` is new — single DEPLOY split-button with mode/difficulty/seed dropdown, merged Intel Ticker consolidating Command Brief + Run Intel + Recommended Action into one dismissible line with (?) popover, slim top bar with username/level/gear/help, quick-access chips for Daily/Gauntlet/Leaderboard/Achievements, and a tabbed Career/Codex/Settings/Support sub-nav that moves the weapons list/bestiary/rules/what's new content off the main fold
- completed this session: `src/components/DemoCanvas.jsx` is new — self-contained 2D canvas sim (player drifts, enemies spawn from edges and are gunned down with particle bursts), 30fps capped, deferred via `requestIdleCallback`, pauses on hidden tab, honors `prefers-reduced-motion`, does not reuse `drawGame.js` so it has no game-state coupling
- completed this session: `src/App.jsx` routes the menu screen through a feature flag reading `?home=` query param and `cod-home-v2` localStorage, defaulting to v2; legacy `MenuScreen.jsx` is untouched and still reachable via `?home=v1`
- completed this session: `scripts/render-startup-brief.mjs` now reads `silMax` from `PROJECT_STATUS.json` and renders `881/1000` instead of the stale `/500` max left over from the SIL v2 → v3 rubric migration
- completed this session: `src/components/HomeV2.test.jsx` added (2 tests — hero + DEPLOY action + tab labels); `src/App.launch.test.jsx` gets a matching `HomeV2` mock so the launch smoke continues to pass now that v2 is default
- validation baseline: `npm test` 151/151, `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` passes (792.29 kB raw / 230.92 kB gzipped index); rollback is `?home=v1` or localStorage `cod-home-v2=0`

## Next Recommended Slice
- [ ] Capture real-world Lighthouse LCP/CLS deltas on production for HomeV2 vs legacy MenuScreen; if ≥200ms LCP improvement confirmed, remove the v1 fallback code path
- [ ] Compare `home_v2_deploy` funnel conversion vs legacy `front_door_action` after 48h of traffic; gate further homepage simplification on that data
- [ ] Mobile polish pass for HomeV2 on iPhone SE (375px) — verify DEPLOY split-button wrapping and that Intel Ticker dismiss persists across sessions
- [ ] Studio Hub/Social Dashboard integration, slice 2 — sync the local `vaultspark.game-event.v1` queue to a Supabase/Hub endpoint when credentials/schema are ready
- [ ] Rivalry network, slice 2 — add a visible rivalry history/rematch panel and challenge streak copy

## Where We Left Off (Session 47 — intelligence/rivalry/trust follow-up)
- Shipped: 5 improvements across 5 groups — history-aware recommendations, local Studio event persistence, local rivalry network, v2 event timeline digest validation, and session-submission extraction
- Tests: `npm test` 149/149 · `npm run lint` clean · `npm run build` passing
- Deploy: pending — repo-local changes validated, not deployed

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: implement the next five highest-impact ideas from the prior handoff queue
- intent outcome: Achieved — each item shipped as a focused production slice without adding LLM/API token spend
- completed this session: `src/utils/runIntelligence.js` now uses recent run history and unresolved rivalry losses to choose menu focus, so advice can become player-specific across sessions
- completed this session: `src/storage.js` now persists normalized local Studio game events and local rivalry results, including seed, target score, win/loss, delta, mode, difficulty, and wave
- completed this session: `MenuScreen` now loads run/rivalry history and saves front-door Studio events before tracking analytics
- completed this session: `DeathScreen` now saves debrief Studio events and records rivalry outcomes when a seeded run ends
- completed this session: `buildRunEventDigest` now emits v2 timeline bands, and `submit-score` validates timeline coherence in addition to final stat bands
- completed this session: `src/utils/runSubmission.js` now exposes `buildSessionSubmission`, and `App.jsx` uses it for digest-aware leaderboard payload shaping
- validation baseline: `npm test` 149/149, `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` passes; build still reports the pre-existing non-blocking `register-sw.js` non-module bundling warning

## Next Recommended Slice
- [ ] Studio Hub/Social Dashboard integration, slice 2 — sync the local `vaultspark.game-event.v1` queue to a Supabase/Hub endpoint when credentials and schema are ready
- [ ] Rivalry network, slice 2 — add a visible rivalry history/rematch panel and challenge streak copy so the stored data becomes a stronger player-facing loop
- [ ] Trust v3, slice 2 — sign the v2 digest/timeline client-side with the issued run claim so replay tampering becomes harder
- [ ] App-domain extraction, slice 7 — move submit-score side effects and analytics/event persistence into a dedicated session completion module
- [ ] Intelligence v3 — use stored Studio/debrief events to detect whether the player follows coaching and whether rematches improve outcomes

## Where We Left Off (Session 46 — Run Intelligence Spine tranche)
- Shipped: 6 improvements across 6 groups — run-intelligence utility, front-door intel, post-run diagnosis/roast layer, compact event-digest trust validation, DeathScreen chunk split, and local startup protocol repair
- Tests: `npm test` 144/144 · `npm run lint` clean · `npm run build` passing
- Deploy: pending — repo-local changes validated, not deployed

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: update durable memory/task board with the combined 10-item quality stack, then ship a coordinated first slice instead of scattering work across unrelated polish
- intent outcome: Achieved as a first integrated slice — the impossible full 10-item rewrite was scoped into production-safe foundations that advance every category without destabilizing the game
- completed this session: `context/TASK_BOARD.md`, `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`, and `context/CURRENT_STATE.md` now record the Run Intelligence Spine and integrated refinement tranche as active public-safe priorities
- completed this session: `src/utils/runIntelligence.js` + tests added — menu recommendation, post-run diagnosis, rivalry prompt, compact event digest, Studio event shape, and rule-based roast callout logic now share one reusable layer
- completed this session: `src/components/MenuScreen.jsx` now shows a Run Intel card and tracks front-door actions with the shared intelligence focus and Studio event payload
- completed this session: `src/components/DeathScreen.jsx` now shows Run Intelligence diagnosis/drill/rivalry guidance, emits debrief intelligence telemetry, includes the first rule-based roast callout, and submits a compact event digest with score submissions
- completed this session: `src/utils/runSubmission.js`, `src/storage.js`, `src/App.jsx`, and `supabase/functions/submit-score/index.ts` now carry and validate compact event-digest bands before leaderboard insert, adding a first event-derived trust layer beyond final-score plausibility
- completed this session: `src/App.jsx` now lazy-loads `DeathScreen`, producing a separate `DeathScreen` chunk and reducing the main production app chunk from the prior ~798.60 kB raw / 234.45 kB gzip baseline to 766.47 kB raw / 224.69 kB gzip
- completed this session: `scripts/ops.mjs action-queue`, `scripts/ops.mjs blocker-preflight`, `scripts/render-startup-brief.mjs`, and `scripts/validate-brief-format.mjs` now exist; action queue, blocker preflight, render, and validate dry-runs pass
- validation baseline: `npm test` 144/144, `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build` passes; build still reports the pre-existing non-blocking `register-sw.js` non-module bundling warning

## Next Recommended Slice
- [ ] Run Intelligence Spine, slice 2 — feed recent run history into menu recommendations so advice becomes player-specific across sessions, not just current context aware
- [ ] Leaderboard trust v3, slice 2 — evolve the compact digest into a signed event timeline summary with wave-clear/checkpoint coherence
- [ ] Studio Hub/Social Dashboard integration — persist normalized `vaultspark.game-event.v1` events server-side for sessions, challenges, anomalies, and debrief follow-through
- [ ] Rivalry network, slice 1 — store challenge seed history and win/loss deltas locally, then surface rematch streaks in menu/debrief
- [ ] App-domain extraction, next slice — extract score-submit/session-completion orchestration around the new event digest path

## Where We Left Off (Session 45 — refinement tranche)
- Shipped: 6 improvements across 5 groups — roadmap encoding, trust v2 groundwork, submit-feedback clarity, App extraction, build-guidance depth, and debrief follow-through telemetry
- Tests: targeted utility/system tests passing · `npm run lint` clean · `npm run build` passing
- Deploy: pending — repo-local changes validated, not deployed

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: record the full next execution stack in durable context, then ship the next quality tranche across trust, front door, build guidance, and coaching follow-through
- intent outcome: Achieved — the repo memory now encodes the full next 10 non-human steps, while the shipped code advances several of them together instead of as isolated polish edits
- completed this session: `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`, `context/TASK_BOARD.md`, and `context/CURRENT_STATE.md` now encode the explicit 10-step non-human execution stack and the newest shipped slice
- completed this session: `src/utils/runSubmission.js` + tests added — run-claim and leaderboard-entry shaping moved out of `src/App.jsx` into a dedicated utility
- completed this session: `src/storage.js` now distinguishes trusted server rejection from real offline fallback, so rejected competitive runs surface real reasons instead of being mislabeled as local saves
- completed this session: `supabase/functions/issue-run-token/index.ts` now returns a signed run summary claim; `supabase/functions/submit-score/index.ts` validates it and best-effort logs anomalies via the optional `supabase/migrations/2026-04-15_run_anomalies.sql`
- completed this session: `src/components/MenuScreen.jsx` now adds "why this now" rationale to the recommended action surface, while `DeathScreen` and `App.jsx` emit follow-through telemetry for submit/replay/copy actions
- completed this session: `src/utils/buildArchetypes.js`, `HUD`, `PerkModal`, `WaveShopModal`, and `RouteSelectModal` now expose doctrine status + next milestone language instead of only raw capstone counts
- completed this session: `src/drawGame.js` now gives bosses/elites/ranged threats clearer contrast, outer threat brackets, and ranged prefire aim telegraphs so crowded fights communicate priority earlier
- completed this session: `src/utils/levelFlow.js`, `src/App.jsx`, and `src/components/HUD.jsx` now bank perk choices during combat, show when doctrine picks are ready, and defer the actual perk modal to wave-clear safe points instead of interrupting active fights
- completed this session: `src/systems/progressionFlow.js` now owns queued perk consumption and wave-clear reward sequencing, pulling another real gameplay orchestration slice out of `src/App.jsx`
- completed this session: `src/systems/perkResolution.js` now owns perk-synergy mutations and archetype capstone bonus application, trimming another dense rules block out of the perk-pick path in `src/App.jsx`
- completed this session: `src/systems/shopResolution.js` now owns regular shop and coin-shop gameplay mutations, including bless/curse resolution, ammo refill math, and nuke/extra-life handling
- completed this session: public-facing feature copy was refreshed across `README.md`, `docs/LAUNCH_EXECUTION.md`, `public/manifest.json`, `public/og-image.svg`, and `MenuScreen` share text so the shipped game is described accurately again
- completed this session: `scripts/closeout-autopilot.mjs` now uses argv-based git calls and top-level error handling so local closeout runs finish cleanly instead of exiting awkwardly after the git step
- validation baseline: `npm test` 131/131, targeted pacing/regression coverage 71/71, `npm run build` passes, `npm run lint` passes with 0 warnings / 0 errors

## Where We Left Off (Session 43)
- Shipped: 4 improvements across 2 groups — gameplay systems (wave director pacing, elite helper cleanup) and protocol/process (prompt sync, local protocol scaffolding)
- Tests: `121/121` passing · delta: +5
- Deploy: pending

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: ship the active Genius Hit List item at production quality, then sync the repo to the latest Studio OS start/closeout workflow
- intent outcome: Achieved — the wave pacing system landed with test coverage and the prompt/protocol sync was completed with executable local wrappers instead of dead references
- completed this session: `src/systems/waveDirector.js` + `src/systems/waveDirector.test.js` added — non-boss waves now run through scouting/pressure/climax/recovery plans with encounter budgeting and elite telegraphs
- completed this session: `src/App.jsx` now consumes the wave director for spawn cadence, wave preview copy, and live telegraph announcements instead of relying on one global spawn-rate curve
- completed this session: `src/gameHelpers.js` now exposes shared elite-application helpers so director-driven surges reuse the existing combat model cleanly
- completed this session: `prompts/start.md`, `prompts/closeout.md`, `START_PROMPT.template.md`, and `CLOSEOUT_PROMPT.template.md` synced to Studio OS `v3.1` with repo-specific command/path corrections
- completed this session: `scripts/detect-session-mode.mjs`, `scripts/check-secrets.mjs`, `scripts/lib/secrets.mjs`, `scripts/ops.mjs`, and `scripts/closeout-autopilot.mjs` added so the synced protocol is runnable inside this repo
- validation baseline: `npm test` 121/121, `npm run build` passes, `npm run lint` 0 errors / 0 warnings, local protocol dry-runs succeed

## Next Recommended Slice
- [ ] Continue `src/App.jsx` domain extraction — progression/reward cadence is now split conceptually, but the orchestration still lives in the main file
- [ ] Continue `src/App.jsx` domain extraction — progression/reward cadence is now partially extracted, but combat/session orchestration still lives in the main file
- [ ] Front-door simplification, slice 2 — keep reducing menu first-contact clutter and sharpen onboarding/rationale around recommended actions
- [ ] Leaderboard trust v2, slice 2 — move from signed claims + anomaly logging into stronger server recomputation and review tooling
- [ ] Level-flow cadence, slice 2 — verify the new banked-perk cadence in live play and tune mutation/shop/perk ordering if the safe-point chain still feels stacked

## Where We Left Off (Session 42)
- Shipped: 5 improvements across 4 groups — security/trust (score plausibility validation), run-feedback (tactical death debrief), pre-run UX (command briefing), build depth/economy clarity (archetype capstones + build-fit recommendations)
- Tests: 116/116 passing · delta: +6 (2 new utility test files, launch smoke still green)
- Deploy: pending — ready to push; no post-push live verification run in this session

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: audit the project, rank the biggest opportunities, then ship the highest-value refinement blocks instead of diluting effort across the full roadmap
- intent outcome: Achieved — encoded the roadmap in repo memory, shipped the top trust/feedback/build-identity improvements, and left the remaining work ranked by payoff
- completed this session: `docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` added and linked from project memory; `TASK_BOARD`, `CURRENT_STATE`, and `LATEST_HANDOFF` updated to carry the ranked roadmap forward
- completed this session: `supabase/functions/submit-score/index.ts` now rejects implausible runs via score/kills/damage/time envelopes and fixes claimed-callsign comparison to use resolved `uid`
- completed this session: `src/utils/runDebrief.js` + tests added; `src/components/DeathScreen.jsx` now renders a tactical debrief with verdict, build identity, strengths, and next-best moves
- completed this session: `src/components/MenuScreen.jsx` now renders a command brief for the selected mode/loadout and weekly mutation before deploy
- completed this session: `src/utils/buildArchetypes.js` + tests added; aligned perk picks now unlock build capstones (Vanguard, Gunslinger, Demolitionist, Tempo) and the current build is surfaced in the HUD
- completed this session: `PerkModal`, `WaveShopModal`, and `RouteSelectModal` now mark build-fit recommendations so players can steer into coherent builds
- validation baseline: `npm test` 116/116, `npm run lint` 0 errors / 13 existing warnings

## Where We Left Off (Session 41)
- Shipped: 3 improvements across 3 groups — pwa-quality (PNG icon build pipeline), monetization-backend (Ko-fi webhook Edge Function), ci-stability (testTimeout bump)
- Tests: 110/110 passing · delta: 0 (no new test files; behaviour covered by existing launch:verify)
- Deploy: pending — changes uncommitted at session end

Public-safe handoff summary:
- session intent: prepare game for public launch — surface anything missing and fix what's fixable in-repo
- intent outcome: Achieved — audit identified 3 in-repo gaps (PNG icons, Ko-fi webhook, robots.txt); shipped the 2 meaningful fixes, skipped robots.txt with rationale (subpath deploy — only origin-root robots.txt is honored by crawlers)
- completed this session: `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` added (sharp-based SVG→PNG converter, skip-if-fresh), `public/icon-192.png` + `public/icon-512.png` generated and committed, manifest.json + index.html wired to PNGs (SVG kept as fallback), `public/sw.js` bumped to `cod-v4` with PNGs precached, `prebuild` hook ensures PNGs stay in sync
- completed this session: `supabase/functions/kofi-webhook/index.ts` created — validates Ko-fi `verification_token`, extracts callsign from `message` field, upserts `callsign_claims.supporter = true`, idempotent via `kofi_events.message_id`
- completed this session: `supabase/migrations/2026-04-14_kofi_webhook.sql` — new `kofi_events` audit table with RLS enabled
- completed this session: `.github/workflows/deploy-supabase-function.yml` extended to auto-deploy the kofi-webhook function
- completed this session: `supabase/functions/README.md` updated with kofi-webhook deploy instructions + webhook URL format
- completed this session: `vite.config.js` sets `testTimeout: 15000` — launch smoke was flaky near 5s default under CPU load (observed 1.2s–5.5s); safely within budget now
- completed this session: `npm run launch:verify` re-run against production — 14/14 live assertions pass (health check 5/5, live site 5/5, launch surface 4/4, shared leaderboard 1/1)
- validation baseline: `npm test` 110/110, `npm run lint` 0 errors / 13 intentional warnings, `npm run build` produces working dist/ with prebuild icon step wired in

## Human Action Required (Session 42)
- [ ] Physical launch QA — verify PWA install prompt/accept on a real mobile/browser combo
- [ ] Physical launch QA — verify one real gamepad/browser combo end-to-end
- [ ] Create Itch.io listing — use copy from `docs/LAUNCH_EXECUTION.md`, upload media from `public/launch-assets/`
- [ ] Add `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` to GitHub repo Settings → Secrets → Actions
- [ ] Add `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` to GitHub repo Settings → Secrets → Actions
- [ ] Apply `supabase/migrations/2026-04-14_kofi_webhook.sql` in Supabase SQL editor (creates `kofi_events` table — required before the webhook's first call)
- [ ] Set `KOFI_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` Supabase function secret, then paste `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/kofi-webhook` into Ko-fi → More → Settings → API & Webhooks
