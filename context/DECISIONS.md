# Decisions

Public-safe decisions only. Detailed internal decision history is maintained privately.

## 2026-04-06 — CANON-008: All VaultSpark IP is proprietary by default

**Decision:** All code, content, assets, and designs created by VaultSpark Studios are proprietary and all rights are reserved by VaultSpark Studios LLC unless an open-source license is explicitly declared and approved by the Studio Owner. No agent may apply or imply an open-source license without Studio Owner direction.

**Applies to this project:** Yes — `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` reflects this project's specific license status.

**Rationale:** VaultSpark Studios LLC is a commercial entity building owned IP. Open-sourcing any project without deliberate strategy gives away commercial advantage and creates ownership ambiguity.

**Studio canon:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-008

## 2026-04-07 — Launch observability is post-launch, not a launch gate

**Decision:** PostHog and Sentry remain optional for this launch window and should be treated as explicit post-launch follow-up rather than a pre-launch blocker.

**Applies to this project:** Yes — the active launch blockers are real-device QA, screenshots, listing publication, and one shared-table compatibility check.

**Rationale:** The current user-facing risk is not a missing analytics key; it is finishing the remaining manual launch execution. Repeatable launch verification already exists in repo for smoke coverage, live Edge Function checks, and live site shell checks.

## 2026-04-07 — Cloudflare Worker config must be source-controlled

**Decision:** The security-header worker and the Call of Doodie path-specific CSP override are tracked in-repo under `cloudflare/` instead of remaining dashboard-only.

**Applies to this project:** Yes — the live deployment path depends on CSP settings that are specific to this game.

**Rationale:** Dashboard-only CSP edits create drift, make rollback harder, and leave future deploy/debug sessions dependent on copy-paste state instead of the repo.
